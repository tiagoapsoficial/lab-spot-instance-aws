# Lab spot instances EC2 AWS
A lab to test AWS Spot Instances to achieve very low costs in a real corporate system scenario. Can you really run a corporate system this way?

Lets using for a small corporation's system. This project tests initial EC2 Spot instances with minimal resources to sustain a minimalist corporate environment.

The system uses:

PHP 7.x

MySQL (Latest version)

Zabbix Server (for metrics and registry)

The 30-day test will monitor:

Count of "Scale Up" and "Scale Down" events of Spot instances.

Volume of failures.

Overall status of the corporate system.

Types of instances provisioned during the 30-day period.

Final user experience and case study results for the enterprise.
